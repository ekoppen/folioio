# Email Service Setup Guide

## Email Configuration Explained

Your portfolio uses a local email service that can work with Gmail SMTP or Resend. Here's how to configure it:

## Email Fields Overview

### üìß **Contact Information** (Public)
- **Contact Email**: The email address visitors see on your website
- **Contact Phone**: Your public phone number (optional)
- **Contact Address**: Your public address/location (optional)

### üîî **Email Service Settings** (Private)
- **Email Service Type**: Choose between Gmail or Resend
- **Notification Email**: Where YOU receive emails when someone contacts you

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Gmail SMTP Configuration**
- **Gmail User**: The Gmail account that sends emails on behalf of your site
- **Gmail App Password**: Special password for your Gmail account (not your regular password)

## How Email Flow Works

```
1. Visitor fills contact form on your website
   ‚Üì
2. Site sends email via your Gmail account
   ‚Üì
3. You receive notification at your Notification Email
   ‚Üì
4. Visitor receives auto-reply (if enabled)
```

## Example Configuration

```
Contact Email: info@yourdomain.com (what visitors see)
Notification Email: your.personal@gmail.com (where YOU get emails)
Gmail User: info.yourdomain@gmail.com (sends on behalf of site)
Gmail App Password: xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx (from Gmail security settings)
```
